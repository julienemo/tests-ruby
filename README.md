Dear corrector, thank you for your time/comments/inspiration

Following is what I have attempted

00_hello.rb : no comment

01_temperature : added data validation : if enter a string,
display "That's not even a number!"

02_calculator : would very much like to add data validation
but there are just too many cases...

03_basic : would so much very like to know how to force user
to enter string arguments. They couldn't know, could they ?

04_simon_says : added data validation.
if negative repeating times, repeat twice still

05_timer : no comment

06_pig_latin : managed to capitalize the capitalized
but didn't figure out how to keep the puncts
stuck coz the string.split(' ') method doesn't
keep puncts
